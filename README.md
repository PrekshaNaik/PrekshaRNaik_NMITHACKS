Update: Round 1 presentation done at 6:02pm on 20th March 2021. Been asked to make 2 changes based on the Judge's suggestions. Have started adding the same."


Being interested in consumption and production of plastic for a few years now. I like to raise awareness about plastic's proper disposal, even if it means resharing an instagram post.  Being an ECE Branch student, I have taught myself web developement and learnt everything from scratch just to realise my dream of making a cleaner and non-toxic world for myself and everyone in it!!

So I am going to work on a web interface to raise awareness on the 7 grades of plastic and how and where to dispose them based on the 5 municipal corporations of Namma Bengaluru.

Implementation using : HTML5, CSS5 and Javascript

Where this could be used? 
Apartment committies and business corporations/ Schools and Colleges could sign up for such pick up services to ensure their plastic waste is disposed and segregated the right way. Every plastic is different and not all of them can be recycled/segregated the same way. So what to do for more information? Learn it through my web interface.
